1,Summarize how the Third Wave developed over such a short period of time and why the experiment was ended.,The Third Wave,https://www.commonlit.org/en/texts/the-third-wave,"<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The Third Wave experiment took place at Cubberley High School in Palo Alto, California during the first week of April 1967. History teacher Ron Jones, finding himself unable to explain to his students how people throughout history followed the crowd even when terrible things were happening, decided to demonstrate it to his students through an experiment. Jones announced that he was starting a movement aimed to eliminate democracy. Jones named the movement &ldquo;The Third Wave&rdquo; as a symbol of strength, referring to the mythical belief that the third in a series of waves is the strongest. One of the central points of this movement was that democracy&rsquo;s main weakness is that it favors the individual over the whole community. Jones emphasized this main point of the movement when he created this catchy motto: &ldquo;Strength through discipline, strength through community, strength through action, strength through pride.&rdquo;[CFU1]</p>
<h2>The Experiment</h2>
<p>Jones started the first day of the experiment emphasizing simple things like proper seating, and drilled the students extensively until they got it right. He then proceeded to enforce strict classroom discipline by emerging as an authoritarian[1] figure. This resulted in dramatic improvements to the efficiency, or orderliness, of the class.&nbsp; The first day&rsquo;s session ended with only a few rules. Jones intended it to be a one-day experiment. Students had to be sitting at attention before the second bell, had to stand up to ask or answer questions and had to do it in three words or fewer, and were required to preface[2] each remark with &ldquo;Mr. Jones.&rdquo; As the week went on, Jones&rsquo; class transformed into a group with a supreme sense of discipline and community. Jones made up a salute resembling that of the Nazi regime and ordered class members to salute each other even outside the class. They all obeyed this command.</p>
<p>After only three days, the experiment took on a life of its own, with students from all over the school joining in. The class expanded from initial 30 students to 43 attendees. All of the students showed drastic improvement in their academic skills and tremendous[3] motivation. All of the students were issued a member card and each of them received a special assignment, like designing a Third Wave Banner, stopping non-members from entering the class, or other tasks to bring honor to the movement. Jones instructed the students on how to initiate new members, and by the end of the day the movement had over 200 participants. Jones was surprised that some of the students started reporting to him when other members of the movement failed to abide by the rules.[CFU2]</p>
<p>By the fourth day of the experiment, the students became increasingly involved in the project and their discipline and loyalty to the project was so outstanding that Jones felt it was slipping out of control. He decided to terminate the movement, so he lied to students by announcing that the Third Wave was a part of a nationwide movement and that on the next day a presidential candidate of the movement would publicly announce its existence on television. Jones ordered students to attend a noon rally on Friday to witness the announcement.</p>
<p>At the end of the week, instead of a televised address of their leader, the students were presented with a blank channel. After a few minutes of waiting, Jones announced that they had been a part of an experiment to demonstrate how people willingly create a sense of superiority[4] over others, and how this can lead people to justify doing horrible things in the name of the state&rsquo;s honor.[CFU3]</p>","Background

2,"Summarize at least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle.",On Tragedy,https://www.commonlit.org/en/texts/on-tragedy,"<h2>Chapter 13</h2>
<p>As the sequel to what has already been said, we must proceed to consider what the poet should aim at, and what he should avoid, in constructing his plots; and by what means[1] the specific effect of Tragedy will be produced.</p>
<p>A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear; it merely shocks us. Nor, again, that of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity: for nothing can be more alien to the spirit of Tragedy; it possesses no single tragic quality; it neither satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear. Nor, again, should the downfall of the utter villain be exhibited. A plot of this kind would, doubtless, satisfy the moral sense, but it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited[2] misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves. Such an event, therefore, will be neither pitiful nor terrible. There remains, then, the character between these two extremes&nbsp;&mdash; that of a man who is not eminently[3] good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice[4] or depravity,[5] but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous &mdash; a personage like Oedipus,[6] Thyestes,[7] or other illustrious men of such families.[Office1]</p>
<p>A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse. The practice of the stage bears out our view. At first the poets recounted any legend that came in their way. Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses &mdash; on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus,[8] and those others who have done or suffered something terrible. A tragedy, then, to be perfect according to the rules of art, should be of this construction. Hence they are in error who censure Euripides just because he follows this principle in his plays, many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending. The best proof is that on the stage and in dramatic competition, such plays, if well worked out, are the most tragic in effect; and Euripides,[9] faulty though he may be in the general management of his subject, yet is felt to be the most tragic of the poets.[Office2]</p>
<p>In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. Like the Odyssey, it has a double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe[10] for the good and for the bad. It is accounted the best because of the weakness of the spectators; for the poet is guided in what he writes by the wishes of his audience. The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure. It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies &mdash; like Orestes and Aegisthus &mdash; quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain.[Office3]</p>","Chapter 13

3,Summarize the various ways the factory would use or cover up spoiled meat. Cite evidence in your answer.,Excerpt from The Jungle,https://www.commonlit.org/en/texts/excerpt-from-the-jungle,"<p>With one member trimming beef in a cannery, and another working in a sausage factory, the family had a first-hand knowledge of the great majority of Packingtown swindles. For it was the custom, as they found, whenever meat was so spoiled that it could not be used for anything else, either to can it or else to chop it up into sausage. With what had been told them by Jonas, who had worked in the pickle rooms, they could now study the whole of the spoiled-meat industry on the inside, and read a new and grim meaning into that old Packingtown jest&mdash;that they use everything of the pig except the squeal.[CFU1]</p>
<p>Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose. In the pickling of hams they had an ingenious apparatus,[1] by which they saved time and increased the capacity[2] of the plant&mdash;a machine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by plunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds. And yet, in spite of this, there would be hams found spoiled, some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them. To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor&mdash;a process known to the workers as &ldquo;giving them thirty per cent.&rdquo; Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be found some that had gone to the bad. Formerly these had been sold as &ldquo;Number Three Grade,&rdquo; but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron.

<p>It was only when the whole ham was spoiled that it came into the department of Elzbieta. Cut up by the two-thousand-revolutions- a-minute flyers, and mixed with half a ton of other meat, no odor that ever was in a ham could make any difference. There was never the least attention paid to what was cut up for sausage; there would come all the way back from Europe old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white &ndash; it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.[CFU2]</p>
<p>There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs.

It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats. These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together.

4,"In 3-5 complete sentences, summarize what life was typically like for a woman in ancient Greece. Cite evidence from the text to support your answer.",Greek Society,https://www.commonlit.org/en/texts/greek-society,"<p>Although the male citizen, with his full legal status, right to vote, hold public office, and own property, may well have dominated[1]&nbsp;Greek&nbsp;Society, the social groups which made up the population of a typical Greek&nbsp;city-state&nbsp;or <em>polis</em>&nbsp;were remarkably diverse. Women, children, immigrants (both Greek and foreign), laborers, and slaves all had defined roles, but there was interaction (often illicit)[2] between the classes and there was also some movement between social groups, particularly for second generation offspring[3] and during times of stress such as wars.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Classes</h2>
<p>Although the male citizen had by far the best position in Greek society, there were different classes within this group. The top of the social tree was the &ldquo;best people,&rdquo; the&nbsp;<em>aristoi</em>.[4] Possessing more money than everyone else, this class could provide themselves with armor, weapons, and a horse when on military campaign.[5] The aristocrats[6] were often split into powerful family factions or clans who controlled all of the important political positions in the<em>&nbsp;polis</em>. Their wealth came from having property and even more importantly, the best land, i.e.: the most fertile[7] and the closest to the protection offered by the&nbsp;city&nbsp;walls.[CFU1]</p>
<p>A poorer, second class of citizens existed too. These were men who had land but perhaps less productive plots and situated further from the city, their property was less well-protected than the prime land nearer the city proper. The land might be so far away that the owners had to live on it rather than travel back and forth from the city. These citizens were called the&nbsp;<em>perioikoi</em>[8]&nbsp;(dwellers-round-about) or even worse &ldquo;dusty-feet&rdquo; and they collected together for protection in small village communities, subordinate[9] to the neighboring city. As city populations grew and inheritances became ever more divided amongst siblings, this secondary class grew significantly.[CFU2]</p>
<p>A third group were the middle, business class. Engaged in manufacturing, trade, and commerce, these were the nouveau riche.[10] However, the&nbsp;<em>aristoi</em>&nbsp;jealously guarded their privileges and political monopoly[11] by ensuring only landowners could rise into positions of real power. However, there was some movement between classes. Some could rise through accumulating wealth and influence; others could go down a class by becoming bankrupt (which could lead to a loss of citizenship or even being enslaved). Ill-health, losing out on an inheritance, political upheavals,[12] or&nbsp;war&nbsp;could also result in the &ldquo;best&rdquo; getting their feet a little dusty.[CFU3]</p>
<h2>Women</h2>
<p>Female citizens had few rights in comparison to male citizens. Unable to vote, own land, or inherit, a woman&rsquo;s place was in the home and her purpose in life was the rearing of children. Contact with non-family males was discouraged and women occupied their time with indoor activities such as wool-work and weaving. Spartan women were treated somewhat differently than in other states, for example, they had to do physical training (nude) like men, were permitted to own land, and could drink wine.[CFU4]</p>
<p>Women citizens had to marry as a virgin and marriage was usually organized by the father, who chose the husband and accepted from him a dowry.[13] If a woman had no father, then her interests (marriage prospects and property management) were looked after by a guardian (<em>kurios</em>), perhaps an uncle or other male relative. Married at the typical age of thirteen or fourteen, love had little to do with the matching of husband and wife. Of course, love may have developed between the couple but the best that might be hoped for was&nbsp;<em>philia&nbsp;</em>&mdash; a general friendship/love sentiment;[14]&nbsp;<em>eros</em>, the love of desire, was to be found elsewhere, at least for the male. Marriages could be ended on three grounds. The first and most common was repudiation[15] by the husband (<em>apopempsis&nbsp;</em>or<em> ekpempsis</em>).[16] No reason was necessary, only the return of the dowry was expected. The second termination cause was the wife leaving the family home (<em>apoleipsis</em>)[17] and in this case the woman&rsquo;s new guardian was required to act as her legal representative. This was, however, a rare occurrence and the woman&rsquo;s reputation in society was damaged as a result. The third ground for termination was when the bride&rsquo;s father asked for his daughter back (<em>aphairesis</em>),[18] probably to offer her to another man with a more attractive dowry. This last option was only possible, however, if the wife had not had children. If a woman was left a widow, she was required to marry a close male relative in order to ensure property stayed within the family.</p>
<p>Women, of course, were also present in the various other non-citizen classes. The group for which we have most information is that of sex-workers. Women were here divided into two categories. The first and perhaps most common was the brothel prostitute (<em>pornē</em>). The second, was the higher-class prostitute (<em>hetaira</em>).[19] These latter women were educated in music and culture and often formed lasting relationships with married men. It was also this class of women that entertained men (in every sense) at the celebrated&nbsp;symposium.[20][CFU5]</p>
<h2>Children &amp; Adolescents</h2>
<p>Children of citizens attended schools where the curriculum covered reading,&nbsp;writing, and mathematics. After these basics were mastered, studies turned to&nbsp;literature&nbsp;(for example,&nbsp;Homer),[21] poetry, and music (especially the&nbsp;lyre).[22] Athletics was also an essential element in a young person&rsquo;s education. At&nbsp;Sparta, boys as young as seven were grouped together under the stewardship[23] of an older youth to be toughened up with hard physical training. In Athens, young adult citizens (aged 18-20) had to perform civil and military service and their education continued with lessons in politics, rhetoric,[24] and culture. Girls too were educated in a similar manner to boys but with a greater emphasis on dancing, gymnastics, and musical accomplishment, which could be shown off in musical competitions and at religious festivals and ceremonies. The ultimate goal of a girl&rsquo;s education was to prepare her for her role in rearing a family.[CFU6]</p>
<h2>Laborers</h2>
<p>Greek society included a significantly larger proportion of laborers than slaves. These were semi-free workers, wholly dependent on their employer. The most famous example is the&nbsp;<em>helot</em>[25]&nbsp;class of Sparta. These dependents were not the property of a particular citizen &mdash; they could not be sold as a slave could &mdash; and they often lived with their families. Generally, they formed arrangements with their employer such as giving a quantity of their produce to the farm owner and keeping the rest for themselves. Sometimes the quota[26] required may have been high or low, and there may also have been some extra benefits to the serfs[27] such as protection and safety in numbers. However, the serf-class or&nbsp;<em>helots</em>&nbsp;could never achieve any real security as they were given little or no legal status and harshly treated, even killed in regular purges[28] (especially in Sparta), in order to instill a fear which would ensure continued subordination[29] to the ruling class. In certain periods such as war,&nbsp;<em>helots</em>&nbsp;were required to serve in the armed forces and, fighting well, they could even earn an escape from their lot and join the intermediary social groups which existed below the level of full-citizen and included such individuals as children with parents of mixed status (e.g.: father-citizen, mother-<em>helot</em>).[CFU7]</p>
<h2>Slaves</h2>
<p>In Greek society, slaves were seen as a necessary and perfectly normal part of city-life. Acquired through war and conquest, kidnap and purchase, slaves were simply amongst life&rsquo;s losers. There were even intellectual arguments from philosophers like Aristotle,[30] which propounded[31] the belief that slaves were demonstrably[32] inferior, a product of their environment and inherited characteristics. Greeks persuaded themselves that it was they who had the best environment and characteristics and the purest blood line and were, therefore, born to rule.</p>
<p>It is impossible to say with accuracy how many slaves (<em>douloi</em>) there were in Greek society and what proportion of the population they made up. It is unlikely, due to the costs, that every single citizen had their own slave but some citizens undoubtedly owned many slaves. Accordingly, estimates of the slave population in the Greek world range from between 15 and 40% of the total population. However, a defense speech made in a court case in Athens by Lysias,[33] and hints from others such as Demosthenes,[34] strongly suggest that if every citizen did not have slaves then they certainly desired them, and to be a slave owner was considered a measure of social status. Slaves were not only owned by private individuals but also by the state, which used them in municipal[35] projects such as mining or, as in the case of Athens, the police force.[CFU8]</p>
<p>The interactions between slaves and owners was similar to the slave-owner relationships at other points in history; there was a mix of contempt,[36] distrust, and abuse from the owners and contempt, theft, and sabotage from the enslaved. Source material is always from the viewpoint of the slave owner but there are references in literature, particularly in Greek comedy, of friendship and loyalty in at least some owner-slave relationships. Whilst the flogging[37] of slaves is commonly referred to in Greek plays, there were also treatises[38] written extolling[39] the benefits of kindness and incentives in slave management.</p>
<p>Slaves worked in all spheres and over 200 occupations have been identified. These include working in the home, in agriculture, industry workshops (e.g.: making shields, food, clothes and perfumes), mines, transport, retail, banking, entertainment, in the armed forces as attendants to their owner or as baggage carriers, as rowers in naval vessels or even as fighters. Farms were generally small affairs with even the richest citizens tending to own several small farms rather than one large estate, therefore, slaves were not concentrated into large groups as in later ancient societies.</p>
<p>For slaves there was &mdash; at least for some &mdash; a glimmer of hope to one day achieve their freedom. There are instances when slaves, particularly those involved in manufacturing and industry, living separately from their owners and given a certain financial independence, could pay for their freedom with money they had saved. Also, slaves in the army were sometimes given their freedom by the state following their victorious exploits.[40][CFU9]</p>
<h2>Foreigners</h2>
<p>Aside from slaves, most Greek&nbsp;poleis&nbsp;would have had a number of free foreigners (<em>xenoi</em>)[41] who had chosen to re-locate from other areas of&nbsp;Greece, the Mediterranean, and the&nbsp;Near East, bringing with them skills such as pottery&nbsp;and metalworking. These foreigners usually had to register their residence and so became a recognized class (lower in status than the full-citizens) called the metics (<em>metoikoi</em>).[42] In return for the benefits of &ldquo;guest&rdquo; citizenship they had to provide a local sponsor, pay local taxes, sometimes pay additional taxes, contribute to the costs of minor festivals, and even participate in military campaigns when necessary. Despite the suspicions and prejudices against foreign &ldquo;barbarians&rdquo; which often crop up in literary sources, there were cases when&nbsp;<em>metoikoi</em>&nbsp;did manage to become full citizens after a suitable display of loyalty and contribution to the good of the host state. They then received equal tax status and the right to own property and land. Their children too could also become citizens. However, some states, notably Sparta, at times actively discouraged immigration or periodically expelled <em>xenoi</em>. The relationship between foreigners and local citizens seems to have been a strained one, particularly in times of wars and economic hardship.[CFU10]</p>","Although the male citizen, with his full legal status, right to vote, hold public office, and own property, may well have dominated Greek Society, the social groups which made up the population of a typical Greek city-state or polis were remarkably diverse. Women, children, immigrants (both Greek and foreign), laborers, and slaves all had defined roles, but there was interaction (often illicit) between the classes and there was also some movement between social groups, particularly for second generation offspring and during times of stress such as wars. 
Classes 
Although the male citizen had by far the best position in Greek society, there were different classes within this group. The top of the social tree was the “best people,” the aristoi Possessing more money than everyone else, this class could provide themselves with armor, weapons, and a horse when on military campaign. The aristocrats were often split into powerful family factions or clans who controlled all of the important political positions in the polis. Their wealth came from having property and even more importantly, the best land, i.e.: the most fertile and the closest to the protection offered by the city walls. 
A poorer, second class of citizens existed too. These were men who had land but perhaps less productive plots and situated further from the city, their property was less well-protected than the prime land nearer the city proper. The land might be so far away that the owners had to live on it rather than travel back and forth from the city. These citizens were called the perioikoi (dwellers-round-about) or even worse “dusty-feet” and they collected together for protection in small village communities, subordinate to the neighboring city. As city populations grew and inheritances became ever more divided amongst siblings, this secondary class grew significantly. 
A third group were the middle, business class. Engaged in manufacturing, trade, and commerce, these were the nouveau riche. However, the aristoi jealously guarded their privileges and political monopoly by ensuring only landowners could rise into positions of real power. However, there was some movement between classes. Some could rise through accumulating wealth and influence; others could go down a class by becoming bankrupt (which could lead to a loss of citizenship or even being enslaved). Ill-health, losing out on an inheritance, political upheavals, or war could also result in the “best” getting their feet a little dusty. 
Women 
Female citizens had few rights in comparison to male citizens. Unable to vote, own land, or inherit, a woman’s place was in the home and her purpose in life was the rearing of children. Contact with non-family males was discouraged and women occupied their time with indoor activities such as wool-work and weaving. Spartan women were treated somewhat differently than in other states, for example, they had to do physical training (nude) like men, were permitted to own land, and could drink wine. 
Women citizens had to marry as a virgin and marriage was usually organized by the father, who chose the husband and accepted from him a dowry. If a woman had no father, then her interests (marriage prospects and property management) were looked after by a guardian (kurios), perhaps an uncle or other male relative. Married at the typical age of thirteen or fourteen, love had little to do with the matching of husband and wife. Of course, love may have developed between the couple but the best that might be hoped for was philia — a general friendship/love sentiment; eros, the love of desire, was to be found elsewhere, at least for the male. Marriages could be ended on three grounds. The first and most common was repudiation by the husband (apopempsis or ekpempsis No reason was necessary, only the return of the dowry was expected. The second termination cause was the wife leaving the family home (apoleipsis and in this case the woman’s new guardian was required to act as her legal representative. This was, however, a rare occurrence and the woman’s reputation in society was damaged as a result. The third ground for termination was when the bride’s father asked for his daughter back (aphairesis), probably to offer her to another man with a more attractive dowry. This last option was only possible, however, if the wife had not had children. If a woman was left a widow, she was required to marry a close male relative in order to ensure property stayed within the family. 
Women, of course, were also present in the various other non-citizen classes. The group for which we have most information is that of sex-workers. Women were here divided into two categories. The first and perhaps most common was the brothel prostitute (pornē). The second, was the higher-class prostitute (hetaira These latter women were educated in music and culture and often formed lasting relationships with married men. It was also this class of women that entertained men (in every sense) at the celebrated symposium. 
Children & Adolescents 
Children of citizens attended schools where the curriculum covered reading, writing, and mathematics. After these basics were mastered, studies turned to literature (for example, Homer), poetry, and music (especially the lyre). Athletics was also an essential element in a young person’s education. At Sparta, boys as young as seven were grouped together under the stewardship of an older youth to be toughened up with hard physical training. In Athens, young adult citizens (aged 18-20) had to perform civil and military service and their education continued with lessons in politics, rhetoric, and culture. Girls too were educated in a similar manner to boys but with a greater emphasis on dancing, gymnastics, and musical accomplishment, which could be shown off in musical competitions and at religious festivals and ceremonies. The ultimate goal of a girl’s education was to prepare her for her role in rearing a family. 
Laborers 
Greek society included a significantly larger proportion of laborers than slaves. These were semi-free workers, wholly dependent on their employer. The most famous example is the helot class of Sparta. These dependents were not the property of a particular citizen — they could not be sold as a slave could — and they often lived with their families. Generally, they formed arrangements with their employer such as giving a quantity of their produce to the farm owner and keeping the rest for themselves. Sometimes the quota required may have been high or low, and there may also have been some extra benefits to the serfs such as protection and safety in numbers. However, the serf-class or helots could never achieve any real security as they were given little or no legal status and harshly treated, even killed in regular purges (especially in Sparta), in order to instill a fear which would ensure continued subordination to the ruling class. In certain periods such as war, helots were required to serve in the armed forces and, fighting well, they could even earn an escape from their lot and join the intermediary social groups which existed below the level of full-citizen and included such individuals as children with parents of mixed status (e.g.: father-citizen, mother-helot). 
Slaves 
In Greek society, slaves were seen as a necessary and perfectly normal part of city-life. Acquired through war and conquest, kidnap and purchase, slaves were simply amongst life’s losers. There were even intellectual arguments from philosophers like Aristotle, which propounded the belief that slaves were demonstrably inferior, a product of their environment and inherited characteristics. Greeks persuaded themselves that it was they who had the best environment and characteristics and the purest blood line and were, therefore, born to rule. 
It is impossible to say with accuracy how many slaves (douloi) there were in Greek society and what proportion of the population they made up. It is unlikely, due to the costs, that every single citizen had their own slave but some citizens undoubtedly owned many slaves. Accordingly, estimates of the slave population in the Greek world range from between 15 and 40% of the total population. However, a defense speech made in a court case in Athens by Lysias, and hints from others such as Demosthenes, strongly suggest that if every citizen did not have slaves then they certainly desired them, and to be a slave owner was considered a measure of social status. Slaves were not only owned by private individuals but also by the state, which used them in municipal projects such as mining or, as in the case of Athens, the police force. 
The interactions between slaves and owners was similar to the slave-owner relationships at other points in history; there was a mix of contempt, distrust, and abuse from the owners and contempt, theft, and sabotage from the enslaved. Source material is always from the viewpoint of the slave owner but there are references in literature, particularly in Greek comedy, of friendship and loyalty in at least some owner-slave relationships. Whilst the flogging of slaves is commonly referred to in Greek plays, there were also treatises written extolling the benefits of kindness and incentives in slave management. 
Slaves worked in all spheres and over 200 occupations have been identified. These include working in the home, in agriculture, industry workshops (e.g.: making shields, food, clothes and perfumes), mines, transport, retail, banking, entertainment, in the armed forces as attendants to their owner or as baggage carriers, as rowers in naval vessels or even as fighters.

<p>The nature versus nurture debate is about which part of a person is more important&mdash;their inherited qualities, which includes genes, or their personal experiences and the way they were brought up. For years, scientists have tried to find out what causes people to have different personalities, behaviors, and characteristics.</p>
<h2>Scientific Approach</h2>
<p>The nature versus nurture debate poses a very complicated scientific question: how do scientists figure out which one plays a greater role in the development of a person?

<h2>The Nurture Side</h2>
<p>The view that humans acquire all or almost all of their behavioral traits from &ldquo;nurture&rdquo; was termed tabula rasa, Latin for &ldquo;blank slate,&rdquo; by philosopher John Locke. This idea proposes that humans develop only from environmental influences. One example of a person&rsquo;s trait that is completely determined by their environment is native language. Studies show that children, regardless of where they're born, can learn any language with equal facility.[1]</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;nurture&rdquo; has historically been defined as the care given to children by the parents, with the mother playing an important role. Now, this term is regarded by some as the environmental (non-genetic) factor of a person&rsquo;s environment.

<p>Some genetic traits are highly heritable,[2] such as eye color. Some disorders or diseases are also heritable.
